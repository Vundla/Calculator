Welcome to the Basic Calculator project! This simple yet powerful tool was developed to meet a fundamental need in everyday life: performing basic arithmetic operations. While this project may not be the most technically impressive application you'll see, it represents a significant step in my journey as a software developer. It reflects my dedication to learning, problem-solving, and creating user-friendly applications.

Inspiration and Team Introduction üé®
The idea to build a basic calculator was inspired by a desire to create something universally useful and to challenge myself to refine my frontend development skills. Calculators are an essential part of daily life,

Process, Collaboration, and Timeline üóìÔ∏è
Week 1: Planning and UI/UX Design

Brainstorming sessions to finalize the user interface design.
Collaboration with our UX/UI designer to ensure the interface was intuitive and visually appealing.
Week 2: Implementing Basic Functionality

Focused on developing the core functionalities of the calculator.
Regular code reviews and feedback sessions helped us maintain quality and consistency.
Week 3: Styling and Responsiveness

Prioritized the application‚Äôs appearance and usability across various devices.
Ensured the app looked great and worked seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Week 4: Testing and Debugging

Conducted thorough testing to identify and fix bugs.
Ensured the calculator functioned correctly and provided an excellent user experience.
Challenges Overcome üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
One significant challenge was managing floating-point arithmetic precision in JavaScript. Initially, operations like addition and subtraction led to inaccurate results due to JavaScript's handling of floating-point numbers. We implemented rounding functions to ensure accurate and consistent results. This experience taught us the importance of precision and attention to detail in software development.

Learnings and Technical Interests üìö
Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of:

UI/UX Design: Importance of creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
JavaScript: Enhanced skills in event handling and DOM manipulation.
Responsive Design: Ensured the application works well on various devices.
Problem-Solving: Developed strategies to overcome technical challenges like floating-point precision issues.
Next Iteration üöÄ
For the next iteration, I envision adding more advanced functionalities such as:

Scientific Calculator Features: Including trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentiation.
Memory Functions: Allowing users to store and recall values.
History Log: Displaying previous calculations for reference.
